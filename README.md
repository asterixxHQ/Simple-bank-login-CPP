# Simple-bank-login-CPP
A basic C++ program using structures, loops, and arrays for storing basic customer details and role-based access for banking management

## Bank Management Login System (C++)
A simple program created for my C++ programming class. It uses structures, loops and functions to manage customer data with different access levels for staff (manager/other staff) and users.

### Logic behind the code
- Customer Login: Access your own account details using your password.
- Staff Login: Two levels of access using company provided passwords:
    - Manager: Views all records (Balances included).
    - Relations: Views all names (Balances hidden).

### What I learned
- Working with structures to group data.
- Using strcmp from <cstring> for password authentication.
- Register multiple records using arrays and loops
